That, and it only did like 16\r\ncolors - all of which were ugly. There were many times I wanted to\r\nchange it, but it was such a bitch I couldn't or wouldn't be bothered.\r\n\r\nThen I had a need for colorizing text generically, in other non-prompt\r\nbash applications, and set out to create a truly useful hi-color echo\r\ncommand that was as easy to use as echo, and hid all that escape code\r\ncrap from the user. From that effort, 'face' was born.\r\n\r\nThen, once I started using git, I went back to my old prompt script\r\n'myprompt', and started hacking in branch support. After about 5\r\nminutes I realized I could leverage face for all of this and even\r\nallow dotfiles and themeing, and set off to create what is finally the\r\n'prompt' feature of bash-color-tools. Only took like 5 years to\r\nactually do it.\r\n\r\nAll of this was not without some really annoying hurdles, and I got\r\nsome excellent help along the way from some great friends like:\r\n\r\nMichael Brooks: for the index color math code\r\nBuck Ryan:      for helping track down the nasty escaping bug\r\n\r\nAnyway, here it is and hopefully you'll find it useful. If you do, let\r\nme know. And if you create some cool themes, send them in and I'll\r\ninclude them in the distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n-C\r\n\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
