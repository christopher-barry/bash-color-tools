bash-color-tools came about mostly out of annoyance that someone
hadn't already done it.

I already had a color prompt I hacked together years ago after reading
the bash-prompt-howto that I had dragged around from box to box,
various work places, etc. It mostly never changed because it was such
a pain to deal with it.

Then I had a need for colorizing text generically, in other non-prompt
bash applications, and set out to create a truly useful hi-color echo
command that was as easy to use as echo, and hid all the escape code
stuff from the user. From that effort, 'face' was born.

Then, once I started using git, I went back to my old prompt script
'myprompt', and started hacking in branch support. After about 5
minutes I realized I could leverage face for all of this and even
allow dotfiles and themeing, and set off to create what is finally the
'prompt' feature of bash-color-tools. Only took like 5 years to
actually do it.

All of this was not without some really annoying hurdles, and I got
some excellent help along the way from some great friends like:

Michael Brooks: for the index color math code
Buck Ryan:      for helping track down the nasty escaping bug

Anyway, here it is and hopefully you'll find it useful. If you do, let
me know. If you create some cool themes, (see ./examples/CUSTOMIZING)
send them in and I'll include them in the distribution.


Cheers,
