 face(8)

 NAME
     face - output colored text to a terminal or to an escape-code formated string.
            Optionally face can be sourced and used as a library, or generate color
            pallette output to the screen.

 SYNOPSIS
     face <-h|-H>

     face <[-P] [-l] [-n] [-e] [-f <color-format>] [-b <color-format>] 'message'>
          color-format := color-name|face-rgb|hex-rgb|dec-rgb

     face <[-v] colors>

     source /path/to/face <libmode>


 DESCRIPTION
     Outputs colored text to the screen, or alternatively outputs a string formated
     for use in the $PS1 prompt variable. Optionally can be sourced and used as a
     library using 'libmode'. Optionally, can output color pallettes to the screen.

     color-format:
         color-format can be in one of four possible input formats:
           * 'color-name', 'face-rgb', 'hex-rgb', or 'dec-rgb'

         'color-name' follows the single-word X Consortium color naming conv-
         entions, such as 'salmon' and 'DarkGoldenrod'. These colors will be
         approximated. 'color-name', when used in low-color mode (-l) is
         limited to the standard console colors;
         white, black, red, green, blue, yellow, purple and gray, plus enhanced
         versions for forground only (e.g. bright<color>).

         'face-rgb' is a triplet of three numbers, each zero-thru-5, where each
         number represents the color saturation of the color it represents.
         For example, 500 represent a red value of 5, and green and blue values
         of zero, representing pure red. 050 would be pure green, and 005 would
         be pure blue. These 3 numbers in combination can produce up to 216
         colors. When the numbers are all the same, as in 333, they represent
         six shades of the grayscale, where 000 is black, and 555 is white.

         'hex-rgb' follows the standard hexadecimal rgb format without the '#'
         prefix, such that FF0000 is red, 00FF00 is green and 0000FF is blue.

         'dec-rgb' follows the standard comma-separated decimal triplet format
         such that 255,0,0 is red, 0,255,0 is green and 0,0,255 is blue.

         NOTES:
           * Invalid specifications will be rendered neutral gray.
           * color-name, hex-rgb, and dec-rgb are approximations due to limited
             color space available in the shell

     -b <color-format>
         Set background color.

     -e
         Process escape sequences in the string to be output, such as \t or \n.
         When used with -P, will preserve the sequence in the output.

     -f <color-format>
         Set foreground color.

     -h, -H
         Terse and verbose help text, respectively.

     -l
         Use low-color mode. Low-color mode is limited to the standard console
         color pallet consisting of the following normal and enhanced (bold)
         colors:

           Background: white, black, red, green, blue, yellow, purple and gray.

           Foreground: All the background colors, plus the enhanced (bold) versions,
                       identified by the 'bright' prefix, e.g 'brightred'.

         Only 'color-name' color-format is valid in low-color mode.

     -n
         Supresses newline at end of output.

     -P
         Outputs a non-evaluated, escape-code formatted string suitable for
         use in $PS1 prompt strings.

     -v
         Used with 'colors' parameter to output 'face-rgb' triplets with the
         color pallette output.

     colors
         Generate color pallette examples to the screen.

     libmode
        When sourced with only the 'libmode' parameter, installs the function
        _face() into the environment to be called via script. This speeds up
        operation as the file 'face' does not need to be loaded on each
        invocation.

 EXAMPLES
     In an xterm (hi-color mode), these all output white text on a red background
      face -f white -b red ' here is my message '
      face -f 555 -b 500 ' here is my message '
      face -f 000000 -b FF0000 ' here is my message '
      face -f 255,255,255 -b 255,0,0 ' here is my message '

     Or in low color mode for the Linux console...
      face -lf white -b red ' here is my message '

     Generate parts of a built-up prompt string for use with \$PS1
      str1=$(face -Pnf 237 'my prompt string part')
      ...
      PS1="${str1}...${strN}"

     Use as a library from scripts...
      source /path/to/face libmode
     Then substitute '_face' for 'face', and all the same options apply.

     Output several funky made-up color pallettes to the screen
      face colors
     include the 'face-rgb' input triple for each color
      face -v colors
