QUICK START

* get code (git or tarball)
* as root, run:
  root@box# /path/to/code/install
* then, as each user that wants a color prompt, run:
  user@box$ setup-prompt
* follow instructions printed on the screen


DETAILED INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

From cloned GitHub repo:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To install bash-color-tools just run './install' from the cloned repo
as root. This will install the absolute latest code system-wide, so
everyone on the box can use it, each with their own personal settings.

To install a particular version, use git describe to identify the
available version tags, then checkout that tag to a branch with:

me@box$ git checkout -b <tag_name>

Then run ./install as root.


From zipfile downloaded from GitHub:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For a specific tagged release rather than master, select the tag in
GitHub's interface, then select the Zip button and download it.

Unzip it:

me@box$ unzip bash-color-tools-<version>.zip

...then install as root

root@box# cd /path/to/bash-color-tools-<version>
root@box# ./install

By default, this will install the code to:

 /usr/share/bash-color-tools/

and the docs to:

 /usr/share/doc/bash-color-tools/

symlinks for the face and print-face-colors commands will be installed
into /usr/bin/.


OTHER INSTALL LOCATIONS

If you perfer to install into a different install root than /usr, for
instance to say /usr/local, or even your own home directory, set the
PREFIX var prior to installing, like:

 root@box# PREFIX=/usr/local ./install

Or

 me@box$ PREFIX=~ ./install

NOTE: keep in mind that executables will have symlinks created in
${PREFIX}/bin. If that bin dir is not in your path, stuff won't
work. If it's not in the path, then add it to your startup script
(e.g. ~/.bashrc) with:

 PATH=${PATH}:/the/prefix/you/used/bin
 export PATH

install will bark at you after installing if that bin dir is not in
the PATH


UNINSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

To uninstall, as root (typically) run the uninstall script located in
the installation libexec directory, which by default is located at:

root@box# /usr/share/bash-color-tools/libexec/uninstall

You'll need to manually remove any personal dotfiles and themes in
your home directory, located in ~/.prompt-themes.d/
