<h1></h1>

<p>bash-color-tools came about mostly out of annoyance that someone
hadn't already done it.</p>

<p>I already had a crappy color prompt I hacked together years ago after
reading the bash-prompt-howto that I had dragged around from box to
box, various work places, etc., and it mostly never changed, because
it was such a mindfuck to deal with it. That, and it only did like 16
colors - all of which were ugly. There were many times I wanted to
change it, but it was such a bitch I couldn't or wouldn't be bothered.</p>

<p>Then I had a need for colorizing text generically, in other non-prompt
bash applications, and set out to create a truly useful hi-color echo
command that was as easy to use as echo, and hid all that escape code
crap from the user. From that effort, 'face' was born.</p>

<p>Then, once I started using git, I went back to my old prompt script
'myprompt', and started hacking in branch support. After about 5
minutes I realized I could leverage face for all of this and even
allow dotfiles and themeing, and set off to create what is finally the
'prompt' feature of bash-color-tools. Only took like 5 years to
actually do it.</p>

<p>All of this was not without some really annoying hurdles, and I got
some excellent help along the way from some great friends like:</p>

<p>Michael Brooks: for the index color math code
Buck Ryan:      for helping track down the nasty escaping bug</p>

<p>Anyway, here it is and hopefully you'll find it useful. If you do, let
me know. And if you create some cool themes, send them in and I'll
include them in the distribution.</p>

<p>Cheers,
-C</p>
